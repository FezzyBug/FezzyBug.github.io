    <h2>How to Choose Headphones</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right headphones is a deeply personal journey. Here are my top considerations:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Sound Quality</td>
        <td>Each headphone brings out a different aspect of the music. Finding a balanced yet detailed sound is crucial.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Comfort</td>
        <td>For long sessions, comfort is key. The ZMF Aeolus is a favorite for its warmth and softness.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Personalization</td>
        <td>Customization can add a unique touch, like with my modded TH-900.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Build Quality</td>
        <td>High-quality materials enhance durability. Metal or reinforced plastic frames usually hold up better over time.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Portability</td>
        <td>Depending on where you plan to use your headphones, consider weight and foldability for easier transport.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Noise Isolation</td>
        <td>If you’re often in noisy environments, good passive or active noise isolation can greatly improve the listening experience.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Price-to-Performance Ratio</td>
        <td>It's essential to find the best quality within your budget. Some headphones offer excellent performance without a steep price tag.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Type of Sound Signature</td>
        <td>Consider if you prefer a warmer sound, a bright sound, or something neutral. This can dramatically change your listening experience.</td>
      </tr>
