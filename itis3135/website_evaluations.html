  <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/">budgetbytes.com</a></h3>
    <p>A small "repository" of recipes ranging from a variety of skill levels, focusing on ease
      of assembly for anyone interested in making a new meal.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> budgetbytes makes excellent use of contrast, specifically with its yellow theming
        highlights against a white background to draw contrast with their recipes. The contrast draws attention to the call-to-action buttons and important
        recipe sections.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Repetition is used a lot throughout budgetbytes, there's use of consistent fonts, colors, and
        spacing across different recipe sections. Making the site cohesive and easy to browse.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> BudgetBytes does a great job with alignment. All elements are aligned with others, ensuring
        that recipe images, text blocks, and buttons are properly aligned, creating a professional, balanced layout that
        guides users through the content effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is well-utilized here as recipe categories and sections are grouped
        logically, making it easy for users to identify and navigate between different types of content. The close grouping
        of related items (like categories of meals) helps with recipe navigation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.temu.com/">temu.com</a></h3>
    <p>Large overseas ecommerce website that specializes in shipping a variety of products in both wholesale
      and single stock direct to consumer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> In terms of contrast, temu.com lacks cohesiveness in how it applies emphasis to key elements.
        "Lightning deals" are plastered across the page in large red boxes, competing with other bold, attention-grabbing headlines.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Temu's site has repetitive elements throughout, with consistent use of fonts and colors. However,
        the over-repetition of certain elements, like product grids and flash deal announcements, makes the site feel cluttered.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The site suffers from poor alignment. While product grids are initially well-aligned, scrolling reveals
        inconsistencies as elements start to become misaligned, leading to a less cohesive browsing experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Temu's layout groups related products and deals together in a reasonably effective way, making it easy for users
        to identify similar items. However, excessive proximity in certain sections leads to a cluttered look.</li>
    </ul>
